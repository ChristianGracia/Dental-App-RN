then get on app store

I work on this app for a few hours a week for a dental office and will be getting this app eventually
to the Apple and Android app store for the patients of the office to use.

This app already displays a ton information related to procedures that can be done at the office such as implants, crowns, root canals, botox, sleep apnea tests, etc.

until its on the app store you have to use expo to view
