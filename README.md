# Advanced Dental Care of Norton App

This repo contains a React Native application that works on iOS or Android mobiel devices. I am making this app for my father's dental office with the hope
of getting it on the Apple and Android app store for the patients of the office to use.

This app will for sure display information related to procedures that can be done at the office such as implants, crowns, root canals, botox, sleep apnea tests, etc.

Will be working on this only while I'm at the dental office because I have many projects going on.

## Goals

If possible there are a lot of things I would like to incorporate in this app. Most of this depends on what Dentrix allows me to do and how much API access costs

* integration with the software the office uses (Dentrix)
* Allow patients to view next appointment
* Allow patients to view balance and ledger
* Allow patients to leave a review
* Allow patients to fill out a contact us form and submit
* Submission form will email form details to the front desk and send a confirmation email to patient using sendgrid
* Add patients to email list to recieve discounts such as 10% next cleaning
* Allow patients to view their own chart
* Add a blog of dental and non dental related articles
