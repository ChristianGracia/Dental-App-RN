# Advanced Dental Care of Norton App

This repo contains a React Native application that works on iOS or Android mobiel devices. I am making this app for my father's dental office with the hope
of getting it on the Apple and Android app store for the patients of the office to use.

This app will for sure display information related to procedures that can be done at the office such as implants, crowns, root canals, botox, sleep apnea tests, etc.

## Goals

If possible there are a lot of things I would like to incorporate in this app.

* integration with the software the office uses (Dentrix)
* Allow patients to view next appointment
* Allow patients to view balance and ledger
* Allow patients to leave a review
* Allow patients to fill out a contact us form and submit
* Allow patients to view their own chart
