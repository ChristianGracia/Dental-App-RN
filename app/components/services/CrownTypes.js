          Permanent crowns can be made from stainless steel, all metal (such as
          gold or another alloy), porcelain-fused-to-metal, all resin, or all
          ceramic.

        <Text>
          Stainless steel crowns are prefabricated crowns that are used on
          permanent teeth primarily as a temporary measure. The crown protects
          the tooth or filling while a permanent crown is made from another
          material. The crown covers the entire tooth and protects it from
          further decay. In general, stainless steel crowns are used for
          children's teeth because they don't require multiple dental visits to
          put in place and so are more cost- effective than custom-made crowns
          and prophylactic dental care needed to protect a tooth without a
          crown.

        {"\n"}
        <Text>
          Metals used in crowns include alloys that have a high content of gold
          or platinum, or base-metal alloys (for example, cobalt- chromium and
          nickel-chromium alloys). Metal crowns withstand biting and chewing
          forces well and probably last the longest in terms of wear down. Also,
          metal crowns rarely chip or break. The metallic color is the main
          drawback. Metal crowns are a good choice for out-of-sight molars.

        <Text>
          Porcelain-fused-to-metal dental crowns can be color matched to your
          adjacent teeth (unlike the metallic crowns). However, more wearing to
          the opposing teeth occurs with this crown type compared with metal or
          resin crowns. The crown's porcelain portion can also chip or break
          off. Next to all-ceramic crowns, porcelain-fused-to-metal crowns look
          most like normal teeth. However, sometimes the metal underlying the
          crown's porcelain can show through as a dark line, especially at the
          gum line and even more so if your gums recede. These crowns can be a
          good choice for front or back teeth as well as long bridges where the
          metal is needed for strength.

        <Text>
          All-resin dental crowns are less expensive than other crown types.
          However, they wear down over time and are more prone to fractures than
          porcelain-fused-to-metal crowns.

        <Text>
          All-ceramic or all-porcelain dental crowns provide better natural
          color match than any other crown type and may be more suitable for
          people with metal allergies. All-ceramic crowns can be used for front
          and back teeth.

        <Text>
          Temporary crowns can be made in your dentist's office, whereas most
          permanent crowns are made in a dental laboratory. Typically, temporary
          crowns are made of an acrylic-based material or stainless steel and
          can be used as a temporary restoration until a permanent crown is
          constructed by a lab.
