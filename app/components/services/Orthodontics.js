          Orthodontic treatments today are no longer just for kids. Many adults
          are choosing to have orthodontic treatments not only to correct dental
          issues that may have affected their oral health, but also for the
          cosmetic benefits of straight teeth. Orthodontic treatments for adults
          include both traditional and clear braces and, for those who want to
          be more discrete with their treatment, clear aligners. While
          traditional braces for adults work the same as those for children, the
          length of the treatment time may be longer. {"\n"}

            Teen Orthodontics

          {"\n"}The teen years are a suitable time to begin orthodontic
          treatments. The bone in the jaw of a teenager is still moldable by
          moving teeth because it has not yet set in its shape. Gaps, crooked
          teeth, overcrowding of teeth and improper alignment of bites can all
          be corrected during the teenage years. While no teenager looks forward
          to wearing braces for a year or two, there have been advances in
          orthodontic technology that gives more choices for orthodontic teeth
          straightening like metal vs ceramic braces and the choice of the color
          combination of the tiny rubber bands. {"\n"}

          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}
          When you hear the term braces, it is usually in reference to the
          traditional braces that require the use of metal wires and brackets.
          These braces are typically recommended for cases requiring more severe
          correction as a result of their durability.{"\n"}

            Six Month Smiles

          {"\n"}
          The Six Month Smiles Bracing System is a clear bracing system for
          adults. Most adults do not want the hassle of having to walk around
          with visible braces for an extended period of time. With the Six Month
          Smiles system, clear braces are used and the primary focus is on the
          cosmetic appearance of the teeth that are visible in your smile, and
          not the position of your bite. Therefore, one can have their teeth
          straightened in just around six months!

          {"\n"}
          The Fastbraces速 Technology straightens the teeth differently from
          traditional braces. Unlike the latter which aligns the crown of the
          teeth first, then addresses the positioning of the root of the tooth,
          Fastbraces速, from the beginning of treatment, works to correct the
          position of the root of the tooth. As a result of this, treatment
          using the Fastbraces速 Technology tend to be completed faster than that
          of traditional braces.

          Many adults simply do not like having to deal with wires and brackets,
          and for them, Invisalign has been the proven choice. Unlike the other
          bracing systems which uses either metal or clear braces, Invisalign
          uses a series of custom-made aligners that are not only so clear that
          they are almost invisible, but they can also be removed for eating,
          drinking, and normal brushing and flossing of the teeth!
